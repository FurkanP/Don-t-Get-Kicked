# Predicting Kicked Cars at Auto Auctions

## Business Problem
One of the biggest challenges for an auto dealership purchasing a used car at an auto auction is the risk that the vehicle might have serious issues that prevent it from being sold to customers. The auto community refers to these unfortunate purchases as "kicks".

Kicked cars often result from tampered odometers, mechanical issues that the dealer is unable to address, issues with obtaining the vehicle title from the seller, or other unforeseen problems. Kicked cars can be very costly to dealers due to transportation costs, throw-away repair work, and market losses in reselling the vehicle.

Modelers who can figure out which cars have a higher risk of being kicked can provide real value to dealerships by helping them to select the best inventory for their customers.

The challenge of this competition is to predict if a car purchased at the auction is a kick (bad buy).
